### [0. Rain](./0-rain.py)
Given a list of non-negative integers representing walls of width 1, calculate how much water will be retained after it rains.
*    Prototype: def rain(walls)
*    walls is a list of non-negative integers.
*    Return: Integer indicating total amount of rainwater retained.
*    Assume that the ends of the list (before index 0 and after index walls[-1]) are not walls, meaning they will not retain water.
*    If the list is empty return 0.
